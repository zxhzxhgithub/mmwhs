# MM-WHS
Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation (homepage: http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zhuangxiahai/0/mmwhs/)

Accurate computing, modeling and analysis of the whole heart substructures is important in the development of clinical applications. Segmentation and registration of whole heart images is however challenging and still relies heavily on manual work, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.

The Challenge provides 120 multi-modality cardiac images acquired in real clinical environment. It aims at creating an open and fair competition for various research groups to test and validate their methods, particularly for the multi-modality whole heart segmentation[1]. It is not only to benchmark various whole heart segmentation algorithms, but also to cover the topic of general cardiac image segmentation and registration and modeling.

Data and Evaluation
Please download the registration form (pls c.f. the homepage) and send the signed form to Lingchao XU and Lei LI (pls c.f. the homepage), who will send you the links. For details of the data, please refer to here (pls c.f. the homepage).
For evaluation of the test data, the participants should prepare a brief description of their algorithm and email with the segmentation results of the test datasets to the organizers. The email should be titled MM-WHS Test Result + Fully Name of the corresponding author, and the segmentation results should be in nifty format in a zip file. All the results should have exactly the same image information as the original CT/MR images (including spacing, size, orientation info and short int data type etc), and the file names should be ct_test_20??_label.nii.gz (?? is the two digital index) or mr_test_20??_label.nii.gz. A method can only be evaluated once.
